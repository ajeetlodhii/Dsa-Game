        <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-300 space-y-6">
            <p><strong>DSA Game Hub</strong> is a platform built to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) more engaging and accessible. We believe that turning complex concepts into fun games can help students and developers grasp them more intuitively.</p>
            
            <p>Our motivation stems from the traditional, often dry, methods of learning DSA. By gamifying the experience, we aim to provide a hands-on, interactive environment where users can practice, compete, and track their progress without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Our Features</h3>
